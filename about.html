                <p>Jeevan Jyoti is a College established in 2076 to provide top most quality education in local arena. We saw a huge gap between the education quality between city colleges and village college. We are constantly trying and improving to get that same quality to the villagers. Currently there is only Management Faculty here in Jeevan Jyoti but in future we are planning to bring other faculties as well. We are glad to announce that our students have secured really good marks thanks to the quality education we are providing. In Jeevan Jyoti we believe 'Education for Aggrandizement'. We accomplish this by hiring top teachers who have previously been to the top colleges in big cities.We are Changing the perception of village education and we made to this position now. In future there will be bachelor level programme as well so stay tuned for that. </p>
